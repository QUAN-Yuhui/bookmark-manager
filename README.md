# Bookmark Manager Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension to view, sort, and bulk-delete your bookmarks.

## Why this extension?

Chrome's built-in bookmark manager lacks a way to:
- View all bookmarks in the order they were added
- Sort bookmarks chronologically or in reverse
- Select multiple bookmarks for deletion at once

This extension fills that gap with a lightweight, privacy-respecting interface.

## Features

- List all bookmarks with clickable links
- Sort by the time they were added (chronological or reverse)
- Select bookmarks with checkboxes
- Bulk-delete selected bookmarks in one click

## How to use

1. Load the extension:
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer mode**
   - Click **Load unpacked**
   - Select this extension folder

2. Click the extension icon in Chromeâ€™s toolbar

3. Use the dropdown to sort bookmarks in chronological order or the reverse order.

4. Select bookmarks using the checkboxes

5. Click **Delete Selected** to remove them

## Permissions

This extension requires the `bookmarks` permission to access and manage your bookmarks. No data is sent or stored externally.
